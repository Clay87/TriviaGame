To get the game to play all one needs to do is - 

Open XAMPP and enable both Apache and MySQL(unsure if Apache is required, just did that
because it was needed in the past)

Open your browser - I used Firefox.

Log into your PhpMyAdmin

Select the 'Import' tab - 'browse' and select the final.sql file

Once this is completed you're able to open a new tab and type in

localhost/final - this should bring you to the first page being able to select a grade and category
to test your might.
